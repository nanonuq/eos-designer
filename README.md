Browser-based design tool for the 1986 abandonware game EOS: Earth Orbit Stations
Welcome to the Earth Orbit Stations Designer!

This program is meant to simplify station design.
To get started, click anywhere to dismiss the instructions.
Please remember that additional stations beyond the starting station cost 250 extra Capex.
To start building, click any module in the grey menu area.
Then, move your mouse over to the black build area.
Click to place the module! Click a placed module to move it.
Station statistics do not include the unplaced module.
To import a station, click \"Import Station\", paste your station code into the box appearing over the button, then press enter.
Press X or Delete to delete the unplaced module.
Press V to duplicate the last-placed module.
Use arrow keys to rotate modules in place.
There is currently no connection or collision check! It is up to you to perform this.
BLUE modules provide resources. 
GREEN modules produce research and have no requirements.
YELLOW modules produce research but have research requirements to build. 
RED modules produce no research and have advanced research requirements.
Every station must have at least a command module, life support, galley & gym, and logistics module. These have all been included in the default station.
Every module must have at least one "puck" on the end of a module directly facing another module's puck. Each module should be accessible to all other modules through these reciprocal links.
